Both IMU and LCD Touch controller are on the same I2C bus. When starting a new 
project a problem linked to I2C initialization may appear. It is because
the IMU and LVGL try to install the I2C driver twice. A quick fix is to go to 
"lvgl_helpers.c" and comment out the "i2c_param_config" and "i2c_driver_install"
parts.
