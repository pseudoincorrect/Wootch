How to setup a LVGL simulator on windows machine to develop sensie GUI without specific hardware.

Main page for LVGL simulators:
Https://docs.lvgl.io/v7/en/html/get-started/pc-simulator.html

We need to install Codeblocks : http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads 

Clone lv_sim_codeblocks_win (LVGL Simulator Codeblocks Windows)
Https://github.com/lvgl/lv_sim_codeblocks_win

Now we got two projects (git repo):
    (1) Sensie with path ${sensie_path} 
    (2) lv_sim_codeblocks_win with path ${lv_sim_codeblocks_win} 

On project (2) folder, open "LittlevGL.cbp" with Codeblocks

The below instructions will happen in Codeblocks

Click project -> build options -> linker settings -> other linker options
Add: (on right panel)
    -mconsole
    -lgdi32
Click OK

Click project -> properties -> build targets -> build targets -> Debug
Change the type (on the right) to "Console Application", check "Pause when execution ends"

In project tree right click LittlevGL -> add files recursively
Navigate to project (1) -> project_sources -> select "gui" -> click "select folder"

Repeat but this time select project (1) -> select "images" -> click "select folder"

We should now, in the project tree, have two folders : 
    one for  Sensie 
    one for lv_sim_codeblocks_win (the one we had initialy)

Click project -> build options -> search directories -> add -> click the "folder icon"
Navigate to project (1) Sensie the project_sources -> add the folder "gui"

Repeat and add the folder "images"

We now need to modify the main.c file of project (2) to use sensie gui
In project (2), open "main.c" and replace its content by the content of the file 
"simul_main.c" of this directory.

We can now click build -> build and run

Now for any code editing we can use another text Editor.
We simply need to tell Codeblocks to automatically update files we modify externally.
Click settings -> environement -> general settings -> uncheck "check for externally modified files"

In my case, I only use Codeblocks for building and running the project, VScode for the rest.
